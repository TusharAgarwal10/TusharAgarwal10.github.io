    <p1>Thanks for visiting the site. But there is nothing to see here. I am still working on the development.</p1>
    <br>
    <p1>The plan is to create a personal website, ofc, which acts sort of like a portfolio. I majorly aim to share all my 
blogs or writings here</p1>
    <br>
    <p1>make a change here to pull on the vscode</p1>
